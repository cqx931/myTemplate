  <h2><i>The Plant Quartet</i></h2>
  <h5>2021</h5>
  <div class="description">
    <p><i>The Plant Quartet</i> is a sound installation that provides an ambient listening experience of plants by using multiple Soniplasts, a custom-designed instrument that translates biodata from plants into sound. Similar as Chloroplasts, which are organelles that conduct photosynthesis in plants, a Soniplast takes bioelectric potential data from a plant and use it to modulate a simple sine wave. Having multiple Soniplasts, the Plant Quartet pays attention to the relative differences in rhythmic cycles among plants and how they contribute together to a musical composition. By amplifying the ubiquitous existence of plants through sound, the objective of the project is to encourage an intimate relationship with plants in a slow, subtle and collective manner.</p>
